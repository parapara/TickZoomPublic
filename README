OBSOLETE ERRORS:
          This version 0.6.x has rendered several entities obsolete in favor of new names that either better
          fit the naming conventions or were suggested by users as more intuitive.
          
          To resolve these errors and warning quickly and easily, see "Resolving Obsolete Errors and Warnings"
          in the User Manual above.
          
RELEASE NOTES:
          See the manual above for current release notes. Also, you can view the exact same notes by clicking
          the "Commit" tab on GitHub or looking at the git log after you do an update. Isn't that convenient?
          Please give feedback on the improved release notes!
